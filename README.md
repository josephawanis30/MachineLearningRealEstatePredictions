## Overview


## Data Sourcing
The preliminary data set was sourced from the FlexMLS Realty portal available to
Real Estate Agents and their clients. The search for data points was conducted
on Friday, May 6, 2002. All houses currently for sale as of May 6th within a
radius of 10 miles from Indian Steel Park in Central Phoenix, with an asking
price of $1,000,000 or less were included in the search. The search resulted in
1,073 houses for sale.

The features of each data point include:
* ID
* Price (Asking Price)
* Address
* Zip
* Status (Active, Under Contract, etc.)
* Subdivision
* Year built
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Approximate Square Footage

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Please see the EDA.ipynb file in the Exploratory_Data_Analysis folder of this repository.

## Process
 The preliminary dataset will be used as testing data. We are planning to scrape data from Zillow using Splinter and BeautifulSoup.The Machine learning  model we are using is Multiple Linear regression model. At this point no SQL database needed. But in the presentation stage planning to use database if needed. 

## Database
SQlite is the database we are planning to use.

## Machine Learning
Multiple Linear Regression
